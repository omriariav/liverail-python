Unofficial LiveRail python class
=========================

Just a small class I wrote and didn't use eventually. LiveRail demonstrate their API with PHP which I don't use (and like;) so I built this class instead. 

Dependencies: 
=========

- Python 2.7
- pip
- xmltodict (via pip)
- requests
- hashlib


How to run:
================

See worker.py for example. 
The token is saved in the class upon login and used for any other requests. 
Any errors are parsed in the response dictionary, so is the payload.


Note:
===========

This is just an experimental class and has no official link to LiveRail whats so ever, it sure can be done better, feel free to use it and suggest improvements. You can hit me up on twitter: @omriariav or via email: omri.ariav at gmail dot com.
